# mnist-reader
A program that reads the MNIST and EMNIST datasets, draws their images on a canvas and shows the character currently drawn.

Please download the MNIST dataset at the following address : 
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Also consider downloading the MUCH HEAVIER EMNIST datasets :
https://www.nist.gov/node/1298471/emnist-dataset (Binary format)

Once downloaded, unzip the "images" files and simply open it with the mnist-reader.

Upcoming functionalities :
- Filter to show only selected characters (or figures).
- Sorting 0->Z and Z->0.
- Image filtering with two threashold : upper (everything equal or above will be full font color), and lower (full blank).
- Another view that shows multiple images at once.
- Saving single or multiple images into PNG, JPG or both types files.

Feel free to comment on my work and to give suggestions.
