# mnist-reader
A program that reads the MNIST dataset and paints its images on a canvas.

Please download the MNIST dataset at the following address : 
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Once downloaded, unzip the "images" files and simply open it with the mnist-reader.

Upcoming functionalities :
- Compatibility with the EMNIST dataset : https://www.nist.gov/node/1298471/emnist-dataset (Binary format).
- At loading a file, automatic searching for the related "labels" file to show what figure (or letter) the image represents.
- Automatic resizability of the canvas.
- Saving single or multiple images into PNG, JPG or both types files.

Feel free to comment on my work and to give suggestions.
