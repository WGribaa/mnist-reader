# mnist-reader
A program that reads the MNIST and EMNIST datasest and draws their images on a canvas.

Please download the MNIST dataset at the following address : 
http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

Also consider downloading the MUCH HEAVIER EMNIST datasets :
https://www.nist.gov/node/1298471/emnist-dataset (Binary format)

Once downloaded, unzip the "images" files and simply open it with the mnist-reader.

Upcoming functionalities :
- At loading a file, automatic searching for the related "labels" file to show what figure (or letter) the image represents.
- Automatic resizability of the canvas.
- Another view that shows multiple images at once.
- Saving single or multiple images into PNG, JPG or both types files.
